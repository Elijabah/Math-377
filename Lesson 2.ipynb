    "6. I read once that violent crime is significantly associated with ice cream sales. That is, as ice cream sales increase, so does violent crime. Do high ice cream sales cause an increase in violent crime? Explain this relationship.\n",

    "6. No there is no causality between these two groups. It just so happens that when ice cream sales increase so does crime rates. This is due to the temperature increase. As temperatures rise, people want a cold treat to help cool off. At the same time, crime increases as it becomes warmer outside."

In an experiment, the scientist intervenes in the observees' lifestyle by controlling the environment around them. This could be done by placing the observees in a confined room or simply giving one group a certain treatment while not to another."
